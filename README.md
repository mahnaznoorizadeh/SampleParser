# SampleParser

Sample parser
This project could be a feature in accounting software. Some of which have a feature where you can go into your internet bank. Do ctrl + a, ctrl + c and then paste this into a textarea and software will parse the bank transactions from that. 
Accounting software are using this for letting the users do their accounting faster and more accurately by reading all the dates and sums from the bank. The user only has to categories the event by getting the dates and sums. 
You know that there are a lot of banks that people use every day. Because the banks don’t have open API’s. So instead of automatically reading from the bank account the user log into their bank and then copy the whole page and then paste it in their accounting software. 
Getting all the bank rows in to system speeds up the bookkeeping a lot for the user as they get the dates, the sum and the title from the bank.
